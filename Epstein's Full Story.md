# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: Current State of the Evidence (2/13)**

The current evidence proves that Jeffrey Epstein was not a "lone wolf trafficking to himself."   
The evidence strongly suggests that he, along with Ghislaine Maxwell, trafficked children to politicians, royalty, billionaires and people of the highest positions in society to record their crimes and use the footage as blackmail (*kompromat*) to influence global power.  
The government’s refusal to release the full files, removal of evidence and the continued protection of perpetrators through redactions prove that an active, state-level cover-up is happening right now. This is looking to be the largest obstruction of justice in modern history.  
I am reposting my comment to Maxwell post. Here are some files that should be investigated. They provide the most direct evidence of "Main Justice" interference and identify key individuals who have been shielded for years:  
​EFTA01681961  
 (The Harold Webb Whistleblower Letter): This letter is essential for understanding how the D.C. office overruled local investigators. Please look specifically for the missing 53-page and 82-page documents referenced in the logistical trail. These files detail the "willful action" of DOJ officials like Alice Fisher who bypassed local recommendations to secure the 2008 immunity deal.  
[https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681961.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01681961.pdf)  
EFTA02731082 (The Missing 86-Page Document): This 86 page memorandum titled  'Investigation into Potential Co-Conspirators of Jeffrey Epstein' has gone missing from the DOJ website. Many pages are blacked out and it redacted several co-conspirators names and information.  Why are they protecting these co-conspirators? And why did they delete the file?  
[https://www.meidasplus.com/p/doj-deleted-an-epstein-prosecution](https://www.meidasplus.com/p/doj-deleted-an-epstein-prosecution)  
​EFTA00037366 (The List of 10 Co-Conspirators): This internal email tracks the status of the "10 CO conspirators." Please find the unredacted names for these co-conspirators. Again, why are they protecting these people? Especially if they are ones granted immunity from the very suspicious 2008 NPA?  
[https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037366.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00037366.pdf)  
​EFTA00078773 (The Cassell/OPR Letter): This file covers the 2005 search warrant tip-off. Look for the unredacted name of the Senior DOJ Official who alerted Epstein’s team 48 hours before the raid, and the senior AUSA who reportedly joined Epstein’s payroll immediately after leaving the department. Again, why are these names redacted? And it's pointing to some deep corruption within the DOJ itself which needs to be investigated.   
[https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078773.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078773.pdf)

“Is the Epstein case going to cause a problem \[for confirmation hearings\]?” Acosta had been asked. Acosta had explained, breezily, apparently, that back in the day he’d had just one meeting on the Epstein case. He’d cut the non-prosecution deal with one of Epstein’s attorneys because he had “been told” to back off, that Epstein was above his pay grade. “I was told Epstein ‘belonged to intelligence’ and to leave it alone,” he told his interviewers in the Trump transition, who evidently thought that was a sufficient answer and went ahead and hired Acosta. (The Labor Department had no comment when asked about this.)  
EFTA00129096   
**PART 0: THE TIMELINE OF IMPUNITY**  
**How the System Protected Epstein (1996–2019)**  
*Before looking at the specific evidence, it is crucial to understand the timeline of how the justice system actively worked to protect Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.* 

# **1996 \- 2008: The "Sweetheart" Deal & The Cover-Up**

* **First Case:** In 1996, artist Maria Farmer filed the first known criminal complaint against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, alleging sexual assault and child pornography to both the NYPD and the FBI & threatened to burn her house down if she spoke. Recent documents confirm that federal authorities logged her report but failed to investigate, allowing Epstein’s abuse network to continue operating for decades. Her sister corroborates this as well.   
* **First Arrest:** In 2006, Palm Beach police prepared a federal case against Epstein for sexually abusing dozens of underage girls, identifying over 30 victims.  
* **The "Fix":** Instead of facing federal sex trafficking charges that carry a life sentence, U.S. Attorney Alex Acosta (who would later become Trump's Labor Secretary) brokered a secret "non-prosecution agreement" in 2007\.   
* **The Immunity Clause:** This deal was unprecedented. It granted immunity not just to Epstein, but to **any potential "co-conspirators"** (the "John Does"), effectively shielding the entire network of elites from future prosecution.   
* **The Result:** Epstein served only 13 months in a county jail with "work release" privileges for 12 hours a day, while his victims were never notified of the plea deal—a violation of federal law.

# **July 2019: The Second Arrest & The Threat**

* **The Arrest:** On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested by the SDNY on federal sex trafficking charges after the Miami Herald exposed the corrupt 2008 plea deal.   
* **The Evidence:** Authorities seized "truckloads" of evidence from his Manhattan mansion, including hard drives, CDs, and thousands of photos. Prosecutors announced they had "massive evidence" of crimes.   
* **The Threat Level:** Unlike 2008, this arrest threatened to expose the entire network. He was denied bail and held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center.

# **August 2019: The "Suicide" (The Silencing)**

* **The Event:** On August 10, 2019, Epstein was found dead in his federal prison cell. The death was officially ruled a suicide by hanging.   
* **The Impossibilities:** The circumstances surrounding his death are statistically impossible for a high-profile prisoner on suicide watch:  
* **Cameras:** The surveillance cameras directly outside his cell reportedly "malfunctioned," and crucial footage went missing.   
* **Guards:** The guards assigned to watch him allegedly fell asleep and falsified security logs to cover it up.   
* **The Cellmate:** Epstein’s cellmate was inexplicably removed just hours before his death, leaving him alone in violation of standard protocol.   
* **The Outcome:** His death officially "closed" the criminal case against him, preventing a public trial that would have forced the release of names and evidence.

After an investigation following his death, this is the Justice Department's official conclusion.  
**THE OFFICIAL NARRATIVE:**  
According to the official July 2025 FBI & DOJ Memo, which concluded an "exhaustive review" of the case, Jeffrey Epstein was merely a "successful financier" who acted alone or with Ghislaine Maxwell to abuse underage girls for his own gratification, with investigators finding "scant evidence" that he operated a trafficking ring for powerful men or that any "client list" ever existed. The Bureau officially rejected all theories of intelligence ties or blackmail operations, concluding there was "no credible evidence" to charge third parties, and maintained that his death was a suicide by hanging made possible solely by jail "negligence" rather than foul play, effectively declaring the criminal enterprise "dismantled" and the case closed.

# **PART 1: THE "SMOKING GUN" DOCUMENTS**

**The Hard Proof That Contradicts the Official Narrative**  
For years, the public was told that Jeffrey Epstein was a lone wolf trafficking underaged girls to himself and that powerful figures barely knew him. The hard data proves this is a lie. These documents reveal a highly organized, international operation with deep financial and social ties to the world's elite.

# **The Kompromat Infrastructure (The Blackmail Proof)**

The physical evidence seized from Epstein’s properties contradicts the "lone wolf" narrative and points to a massive data-collection operation.

* ***The "Enterprise-Grade" Surveillance:*** FBI photos from the August 2019 raid on Little St. James show a server rack with high-end **Ubiquiti surveillance equipment**, including "UniFi Video G3" cameras and a Video Recorder. Experts state the setup was far beyond what was needed for a private home, describing it as an "enterprise-grade communications operation" designed to log every device and interaction*.*   
* **Pinhole Cameras & NYC Mansion:** Reports from 2024 and 2025 confirm federal prosecutors found evidence of wiring for hidden cameras and "motion-detected" devices in household items like Kleenex boxes.  
* ***The Manhattan Safe:*** When the FBI raided Epstein's Upper East Side mansion, they found a  large assortment of  evidence. Despite this, the DOJ has noted that "no new prosecutions" are expected based on this footage, fueling claims of a cover-up*.*   
* **The Financial Treasury Files:** Banking records detail over **4,700 wire transfers** totaling nearly **$1.1 billion** flowing through just *one* of Epstein's accounts. Major banks flagged a staggering **$1.5 billion** in transactions as "suspicious," yet no regulatory body stopped the flow of money. 

**The Flight Logs: The "Lolita Express" Manifests**

* **Epsteins Island** in St Thomas is one of his properties where a lot of the trafficking would occur.   
* *Flight logs confirm Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane at least 2 dozen times as well as Prince Andrew & Kevin Spacey*   
* Official pilot logs document Donald Trump flying on Epstein’s plane at least **7 times**, often accompanied by his family members. This directly contradicts claims that he "barely knew" Epstein.   
* Most flight logs missing for most of 2010s . Private aircraft operators are legally required to maintain records of the pilot's name, flight time, and load manifests.  
* **The "Little Black Book" (The Inner Circle):** Epstein’s personal contact book contains specific names **circled in red**, allegedly by his house manager to **identify key players in the trafficking** ring. Circled names include Donald Trump, Courtney Love, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and attorney Alan Dershowitz.  
* **The "Jane Doe" Federal Lawsuit:** A 2016 federal lawsuit (Case No. 1:16-cv-07673) alleged that Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein raped a 13-year-old girl at a Manhattan residence in 1994\. The filing included an affidavit from a recruiter ("Tiffany Doe") who claimed to have procured victims for the pair. The lawsuit was withdrawn only after the plaintiff reportedly received multiple death threats.  
* Why was the Tiffany Doe affidavit filed in support of the Katie Johnson rape lawsuit removed from the justice.gov site? [https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01250883.pdf](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01250883.pdf)  
*   
* **The "Zorro Trust":** Documents reveal the "Zorro Trust" was owned by Epstein longer than his island, suggesting this entity (and the New Mexico ranch it controlled) may hold key evidence often overlooked by the focus on Little St. James   
* Multiple survivor testimonies—including **Virginia Giuffre** and **Maria Farmer** describing the 10,000-acre New Mexico property as a site of systemic sex trafficking and a proposed "baby farm" for his eugenics projects, federal prosecutors admitted in a **December 2019 email** that the FBI **never conducted a full search** of the ranch..  
* $100 million lottery win in New Mexico very shortly after his 2008 arrest and the money went to his Zorro Trust  
* **The "Missing" Hard Drives:** The FBI seized hard drives and CDs from Epstein's safe that reportedly contain thousands of hours of footage. Despite possessing this trove of evidence, no arrests have been made based on these recordings.

**PART 2: THE MACHINERY OF ABUSE**  
Due to massive government redactions, the full picture remains obscured. However, by cross-referencing emails, anonymous tips, and allegations, we can start to reconstruct a disturbing outline of how this trafficking ring potentially operated.  
***A Note on the Evidence:*** While much of these details are assumptions based on emails, verified and mostly unverified tips that should be taken with a grain of salt, outrightly dismissing them would be a mistake. In data analysis, **consistency is correlation.**  
When independent sources repeatedly point to the same conclusions, they form a pattern we cannot ignore, especially considering the Justice Department sat on similar evidence for decades without acting. Given that track record of negligence, we must look at the signs the system chose to overlook.  
**The "Logistics" of Exploitation**

* **The "Baby Hair" Texts:** [A PDF of iMessage screenshots reveals the "nightmare on paper" logistics of the ring.](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01619306.pdf) Handlers casually discuss managing "the kid," debating if a bikini wax is possible because her hair is "too short" and explicitly described as "BABY HAIR."  
* **The "Pornhub Introduction":** The [same logs](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01619306.pdf) coordinate moving a child from a salon to "the house," equipped with an iPad portfolio for what handlers explicitly call a "pornhub introduction."  
* **Measuring & Rating:** A file details allegations that [Epstein would measure children’s private parts with his fingers and "rate the children on tightness,"](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) treating them like livestock.  
* [Procurement of babies](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qw6pm7/babies_warningcontent_is_disturbing/) \- **Original post was this one but it seems the post was deleted.**   
* 2 or 3 of the emails [in this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1r2stke/suspicious_emails_where_age_girls_are_mentioned/) are related to the original post

# **Acts of Extreme Violence & "Snuff"**

* **Reference to Snuff Photo:** FBI references a [photo with men holding a prepubescent girls](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1r5dhzc/cannot_believe_what_im_reading/) legs open with vagina gashed and blood gushing out.   
* **Mention of Torture Videos**: Mention of ‘[loving the torture video](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82xgd2g3yo)’ in an email with Epstein  
* **The "Blood & Injuries" Letter:** [A 2020 letter to the SDNY describes a victim’s allegation of being violently assaulted in images showing "blood, injuries, \[and\] multiple adult men."](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078198.pdf)  
* **Intimidation via Gore:** [After this victim sought therapy, the same network allegedly sent those exact violent abuse photos to her phone with the threat: "This is what will happen to you if you talk."](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00078198.pdf)  
* **The "Punch":** A witness statement alleges that when a [victim bit Donald Trump while resisting oral sex](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf), he "punched her in the face."  
* **The "Dog" Incident:** A specific tip [alleges a 5-year-old victim was forced to engage in sexual acts with a dog.](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249860.pdf)  
* **Israeli billionaire Leon Black** [allegedly raped a 7-year-old girl, bit her private parts, jammed sharp objects inside her and made her bleed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1r31hzq/israeli_billionaire_leon_black_allegedly_raped_a/)   
* **Sexual torture of Prepubescent:** Alleged [sexual torture of 6-8 year old,](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249597.pdf) including Prince Andrew

# **The "Disposal" & Murder Allegations**

* **"Fertilizer":** [Disturbing tips](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01660679.pdf) stating that girls were "disappearing" and "ending up as fertilizer for the golf fields."  
* **Burial Sites:** [An email claims Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell "buried two girls" after strangulation and that video proof exists](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qvyb3v/email_claims_epstein_and_ghislaine_buried_two/). **But it’s likely not credible due to him asking for 1 BTC worth 9K at the time.**   
* [Another tip points to bodies being "murdered and buried" at a facility in Rancho Palos Verdes.](https://www.threads.com/@ravencroftblr/post/DUJf_9Tj7bs/this-is-the-only-bit-i-found-about-bodies-being-buried-it-mentions-rancho-palos) [2 girls strangulated during sex buried in Zorro Ranch.](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00067072.pdf) These are only alleged but we do know that Zorro Ranch was never searched/investigated.  
* Maria Framer, along with other witnesses have mentioned Zorro Ranch as a a place where much of the abuse happened.   
* **Witness Reported Dead**: A witness [reported to the federal authorities that said she was raped by Trump & Epstein](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%208/EFTA00020517.pdf). She was later found dead. The DOJ never interviewed the witness. 

# **PART 3: SYSTEMIC COMPROMISE**

The operation appears to be a sophisticated honey trap designed to collect blackmail (Kompromat) on global leaders, ensuring their silence and obedience. We know he had cameras in all of his properties. We know was in deep connections with many powerful people… many who visited his island, his parties and rode in his plane. We knew he was trafficking young girls.   
**Who was he working for?**

# **The "Kompromat" & Surveillance**

* **Intelligence Asset:** Epstein’s properties were heavily wired with enterprise-grade hidden cameras and data-loggers to capture blackmail on his powerful visitors. Meanwhile, JP Morgan executives helped him bypass federal limits to process over $1 billion in suspicious transfers, effectively covering up his trafficking network for 15 years.

**Mossad, CIA, KGB**

* **Shadow Asset Management:** A 2017 FBI report included in the files quotes a confidential source alleging that Epstein was involved in **managing shadow assets for Vladimir Putin** and other global leaders.  
* **Potential Mossad  Spy**: FBI Informant claimed that Jeffrey Epstein was spy for Mossad  
* **The Recruitment Link:** Former intelligence officials, including **Ari Ben-Menashe** (a former Israeli military intelligence officer), have alleged that it was through Robert Maxwell that Epstein was first recruited as an asset. Ben-Menashe claims to have seen Epstein in Robert Maxwell's London offices as early as the 1980s.  
* **The PROMIS Scandal:** Robert Maxwell is alleged to have helped Mossad distribute a "bugged" version of **PROMIS (Prosecutor’s Management Information System)** software. Originally developed by the U.S. firm Inslaw, the version Maxwell sold to dozens of countries reportedly contained a **"**backdoor**"** that allowed Israeli intelligence to monitor global financial and government data in real-time.  
* **The State Funeral:** Following his mysterious death at sea in 1991, Maxwell was given what many describe as a state funeral in Israel with the prime minister and president,, intelligence officials.  
* **The Social Architect:** While Epstein provided the finance, Robert Maxwell’s daughter Ghislaine Maxwell provided the access. She used her father’s elite connections to introduce Epstein to powerful figures like Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, and various heads of state. Could be a classic "social engineering" tactic used in intelligence to place assets in proximity to power.  
* She had a methodical "grooming" process to lower victims' defenses, posing as a maternal or mentor figure to normalize physical contact before delivering them to Jeffrey Epstein.   
* **The "Middleman" & CIA Director:** Calendars revealed that current CIA Director **William Burns** met with Epstein three times in 2014 (while Burns was Deputy Secretary of State). Burns has since expressed regret, stating he only knew Epstein as a "financial expert." . Note, that this is after his first conviction in 2007\.  

# **PART 4: THE COVER-UP & THE TIMELINE**

**How the Government is Hiding the Truth Right Now**  
The cover-up is still happening today. Despite campaign promises of transparency, the current administration has actively worked to bury the Epstein files, scrub evidence from the internet and silence the investigation.

# **The Timeline of the Flip-Flop**

* **2016-2024 (The Promise):** Donald Trump and his surrogates repeatedly campaigned on "releasing the Epstein files," using it as a cudgel against political opponents.   
* Vivek ran on ‘*I will release the Jeffrey Epstein client list without exception*’  
* JD Vance cited the Epstein list as a specific example of why the current government was corrupt, implying that the DOJ was protecting powerful liberals with statements like*’"Seriously, we need to release the Epstein list. That is an important thing... ‘*  
* Donald Trump Jr *“"Show us all the Epstein client list now\!\!\!*”Why would anyone protect those scum bags? Ask yourselves this question daily and the answer becomes very apparent\!\!"  
* Kash Patel,*, “Anyone else want to see the Diddy list, that the FBI and DOJ have but wont release… just like Epstein blackbook?*  
* Donald Trump when asked about the files during the 2024 campaign *“ I’d be inclined to do the Epstein. I’d have no problem with it."”*  
* **February 2025 (The Setup):** Attorney General Pam Bondi confirms the Epstein client list exists and is "sitting on my desk."  
* **Pam Bondi on video** saying there are 10s of thousands of hours of video of kids  
* **Feb 27, 2025 (The Influencer Event):** Bondi hosts \~15 right-wing influencers (including *Libs of TikTok* and *Jack Posobiec*) at the White House. She hands them binders labeled **"The Epstein Files: Phase 1."**  
* **The Letdown:** The influencers quickly discover the binders contain only old, already-public flight logs and "nothingburgers." No client list is included.  
* **The Cover Story:** Simultaneously, Bondi releases a letter claiming she was "surprised" to learn the FBI (specifically the NY field office) was withholding thousands of pages, effectively shifting blame to the bureaucracy.  
* **July 2025 (The Pivot):** The DOJ releases a memo declaring the case "closed," claiming Epstein acted alone and that no client list exists.  
* **July 15, 2025 (Trump’s Reversal):** One week after the memo, President Trump’s tone shifts dramatically.  
* **The Quote:** When pressed by reporters, he says: **"It’s pretty boring stuff... I don’t know why people are so interested in it... It’s a waste of time."** He calls the continued interest a "hoax" and suggests "bad people" are keeping the story alive.  
* When pressed, Trump snaps "Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? ... This creep... waste of time."  
* When asked if the DOJ was protecting donors, Trump replied: *"It is a Democrat hoax that never ends... We've given thousands of pages of files."*  
* Amidst congressional pressure, Trump initially stated: *"I don't care about it, released or not.*’  
* Trump told reporters in the Oval Office in July 2019 that he was completely oblivious to Epstein's specific crimes.  
* In an FBI interview, Chief Reiter stated that Donald Trump called him in 2006 to congratulate him and tell the Chief that "everyone has known" what Epstein was doing and specifically warned him that **Ghislaine Maxwell was "evil" and he should "focus on her."**

# **The Active "Clean-Up" Operation**

* **The 24-Hour "Flagging" Team:** Whistleblowers allege the FBI ordered 1,000 agents to work 24-hour shifts reviewing 100,000 Epstein records, with specific instructions to **"flag" and remove** any records mentioning Donald Trump.  
* **Scrubbing the Web:** Key evidence, including the unredacted "Katie Johnson" lawsuit documents, has been repeatedly scrubbed from government websites and replaced with heavily redacted versions. At least 16 files have disappeared from DOJ webpage for documents related to Jeffrey Epstein  
* **Nov 19, 2025 (The Law):** The **Epstein Files Transparency Act** (H.R. 4405\) is signed into law, legally mandating the release of *all* files.  
* **Dec 19, 2025 (The Deadline Missed):** The statutory deadline passes. The DOJ fails to comply fully.  
* The DOJ releases a small batch (3,965 files).,Entire documents (including a 119-page grand jury transcript) were completely blacked out, rendering them useless.  
* **The Redaction:** A small batch of files were released in early January. Entire documents (including a 119-page grand jury transcript) were completely blacked out, rendering them useless.  
*  At least 16 files have disappeared from DOJ webpage for documents related to Jeffrey Epstein  
* **The 15TB Data Blackout:** Despite recent massive document dumps, the DOJ has only released roughly 300GB of the estimated 15 Terabytes of data seized from Jeffrey Epstein. To put that into perspective, just one terabyte can hold up to 250,000 photos, meaning the government is still deliberately hiding 98% of the evidence from the public.  
* **Redacting the Perpetrators:** Several weeks later, they release 3 million more files and The DOJ has released files where the names of traffickers are redacted, but the names of victims and even a child being sold were left visible.  
* Redacting name of person saying age 10 with image attached  
* “Thank you for a fun night… Your littlest girl was a little naughty.”  
* “I loved the torture video”

**Feb 11, 2026 (The Hearing):** AG Pam Bondi testifies before Congress and only attacks others and cites the Dow being up 500 points as why this should get ignored.  

* **The "Spy List":** Photographers capture a close-up of Bondi’s papers. One document is clearly labeled **"**Jayapal Pramila Search History,**"** confirming the DOJ was surveilling the search terms of Congress members investigating the cover-up.

# **PART 5: PATTERNS & DARKER IMPLICATIONS**

Here, we move from hard evidence to pattern recognition. While this section is speculative and relies on connecting loose threads, the recurring language and behaviors in the files hint at a disturbing subculture that warrants an open-minded look. Of course, take much of this with a grain of salt since its more speculative.

* **Recent Witness Corrobrates Outlandish Claims**: 2 months before the latest dump that involved allegations of things beyond rape such as torture and murder, [Iraq Veteran William Sascha Riley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84PHEMLab6g), an alleged victim, made allegations about rape, torture and murder within the Trump/Epstein and assosciated enterprises. [Here is summary of the long interview](https://lisevoldeng.substack.com/p/dont-worry-boys-are-hard-to-find?triedRedirect=true)   
* **"Pizza" & & “Jerky” & Other Potential Codes:** Emails in the files contain references to "pizza," "pasta," and other terms that align with allegations of coded language used by pedophile rings to discuss victims. This [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1qsiikn/epstein_appeared_to_use_pizza_as_a_code_for/) is a great start to this topic. [Beef Jerky is also mentioned 383](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1qugiyw/beef_jerky_is_mentioned_383_times_in_the_files/) times in the files, with emails saying he will start eating regular food again so [he’ll have to eat less jerky or of keeping 6 bags of jerky in a freezer](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00555763.pdf) (it’s atypical to keep jerky in a freezer as it tend to defeat the purpose)  
* Cheesy Pizza in some cases stands for child po\*\* in those such circles. Pizza has a long history with CSPAM.   
* Epstein’s staff emailed over 300 times about ordering and trading bulk "jerky," yet his [detailed instructions](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2010/EFTA01733626.pdf) to his personal chef never mention it in [estate manuals](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01083625.pdf). This glaring omission further suggests "jerky" was a code word for trafficking logistics.  
* **"Baby" & "Breeding":** Disturbing emails refer to "babies" and "designer babies" as if they are commodities being updated or traded, suggesting a market for infants.   
* [Birth babies for black market use](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00165118.pdf)  
* [Series of emails regarding babies and buying blankets](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1qu3l34/awful_lot_of_documents_referring_to_babies_and/)  
* Series of [creepy emails of people sending their childs ages to Epstein (newborn ages)](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1qw6pm7/babies_warningcontent_is_disturbing/) (This got deleted for some reason but you can see reddit post confirming it. Can someone find those files? Or archive of them?)  
* **"Eating" Allegations:** The most extreme files allegedly contain stories about people on a yacht "dismembering and eating the intestines of babies"—claims that, while horrifying, align with the most extreme "snuff" allegations.  
* These claims are from anonymous tips or hints from emails.. An email saying [kiddies are delicious](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02695174.pdf)  and another email with a conversation in regards to [elites satanic rituals & adrenochrome and organ  harvesting](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA00165018.pdf) and   
* This email about a cream cheese baby and a [baby being better than a bagel](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02440165.pdf) .

* **Nightmare Journal:** [Four files scanned from a child's journal describing in first-person the most disturbing things you’ll ever read](https://www.reddit.com/r/Epstein/comments/1qrtjiw/four_files_scanned_from_a_childs_journal/?share_id=H3ZprfcQeLVu59fG_3C7c&utm_content=2&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1)  
* **Death of Many Witnesses:** A pattern of "suicides" or conveniant deaths surrounds the case.  
* **Jeffrey Epstein:** The primary figure and financier was found dead in his jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking, a death ruled as suicide by hanging.  
* **Jean-Luc Brunel:** A French modeling agent and close Epstein associate accused of procuring young girls was found hanged in his Paris prison cell in February 2022 while awaiting trial.  
* **Virginia Giuffre** (Died April 25, 2025): One of primary Maxwell & Epstein accusers. Her death in Western Australia was ruled a suicide. In 2019, she said she wasn’t suicidal. It is the most significant loss among the accusers as her testimony was central to the civil cases against Prince Andrew and others.  
* **Mark Middleton:** A former special assistant to President Bill Clinton who authorized Epstein’s White House visits was found dead in May 2022 with a gunshot wound to the chest and an extension cord around his neck, ruled a suicide.   
* **Steven Hoffenberg:** Epstein’s former mentor and business partner, who spent 18 years in prison for a Ponzi scheme and claimed Epstein was his "architect," was found dead of natural causes in his apartment in August 2022.   
* **Steve Bing:** A wealthy financier, philanthropist, and Clinton friend who appeared in Epstein’s "Little Black Book" died by suicide after jumping from his apartment building in June 2020\.  
* **Bill Richardson:** The former New Mexico Governor and UN Ambassador, who was named in sealed court documents by an accuser but denied any wrongdoing, died of natural causes in his sleep in September 2023\.  
* **Ruslana Korshunova:** A model who flew on Epstein’s jet to his private island in 2006 (two years before her death) died by suicide after falling from her Manhattan apartment balcony in 2008\.  
* **Thomas H. Lee:** A billionaire private equity financier who was in Epstein’s social circle and found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his office in February 2023.   
* **Bill Richardson (Died Sept 1, 2023\):** Former New Mexico Governor and UN Ambassador. He was named in the unsealed court documents and accused by Giuffre, but died of natural causes before any potential legal action could be taken.

# **PART 6: PEOPLE OF INTEREST** 

**They Knew.**   
Context is everything. Many of the connections listed below continued well after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. These were conscious decisions to remain in the orbit of a known sex trafficker. (Missing quite a bit)

* **Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem:** The leader of ports operator DP World resigned after Representative Thomas Massie revealed an unredacted DOJ email where Sulayem [told Epstein he ‘loved the torture video.’](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce82xgd2g3yo)  
* **Howard Lutnick:** US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik c[onfirmed he visited Epstein's island,](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx9vq0ne0o) contradicting his previous claims that he had cut ties with him in 2005\.  
* **Kathy Ruemmler:** Goldman Sachs Top Lawyer resigned after emails [showed her 'adoring' "Uncle Jeffrey"](https://apnews.com/article/kathy-ruemmler-resigns-goldman-sachs-epstein-3ba7b9e87cc8e38f563f91917630e484?utm_source=onesignal&utm_medium=push&utm_campaign=2026-02-12-Breaking+News) and [giving him legal advice](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/12/goldman-sachs-lawyer-resigns-jeffrey-epstein) regarding the 2015 Virginia Giuffre allegations..  
* **Bill Gates:** Late-stage documents and [2026 DOJ releases confirm Gates met with Epstein dozens](https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-release-sheds-light-on-epsteins-ties-to-presidents-business-titans-and-royals/) of times after his 2008 conviction, including stays at his NY mansion. The files also revealed a strange drafted email from Epstein to Gates in regards to STDs and other things.  
* **Robin Leach:** allegedly [strangled and killed a girl at a Donald Trump child-sex party,](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%209/EFTA01249507.pdf) and she was buried, with others, behind the 19th hole of his golf course.  
* **RFK Jr**: Went [‘dinosaur bone hunting’ with Jeffrey](https://people.com/rfk-jr-went-dinosaur-bone-hunting-with-jeffrey-epstein-and-ghislaine-maxwell-11902099) Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell   
* **Trump Admin:** In a December 2016 email to Bill Gates, [Epstein told him to “come to visit the island.](https://newrepublic.com/post/206556/epstein-email-trump-officials-first-term) New administration people visiting.”   
* Epstein [says he's hanging with the "Trump boys" in](https://www.justice.gov/epstein/files/DataSet%2011/EFTA02666063.pdf) Palm Beach just 6 days after this one.  
* **Prince Andrew**: Sex trafficking probe into [ex-prince over 90 flights carrying girls](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15556521/Andrew-flew-girl-UK-Epsteins-Lolita-jet-took-Buckingham-Palace-Pressure-mounts-launch-sex-trafficking-probe-ex-prince-90-flights-carrying-girls-world.html) from around the world  
* **Dr. Oz**: In 2016, Dr. Oz, [invited Epstein over for a Valentine’s party](https://newrepublic.com/post/206510/dr-oz-epstein-files)

**PART 7: HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS & SYSTEMIC FAILURES**   
**Why We Must Look Further**   
This section compiles "similar stories" or cases that share disturbing parallels with the Epstein network but were similarly dismissed or buried by authorities.  
We now know for a fact that the justice system ignored, minimized and actively covered up the Epstein case for decades. This proven negligence forces us to ask a difficult question: **If they were wrong about Epstein for 20 years, what else have they been wrong about?**   
When the 'official story' comes from the very institutions that allowed these crimes to happen, we can no longer accept it as the absolute truth. We have to consider that other 'debunked' allegations may potentially hold some truth,and that those victims,just like Epstein’s were simply silenced by money, power, and threats.  
 If the people writing the official reports are the same ones protecting the guilty, what is stopping them from manipulating the findings, intimidating witnesses or making inconvenient evidence disappear? After decades of deliberate negligence, they have proven that we can no longer take them at their word

* **Elite pedophile ring in the 70s:** In the 1970s, millionaire [Frank Shelden ran a tax-exempt "summer camp" for boys](https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/crime/north-fox-island-frank-shelden-fbi-files-epstein-b2918769.html) on a private Michigan island that was actually a front for a massive, elite pedophile ring. Victims were flown in on private planes for depraved abuse but the operation was quickly covered up, allowing Shelden to flee the country and avoid justice.   
* **Isaac Kappy Suspcious “Suicide”**: Actor Isaac Kappy publicly accused several high-profile Hollywood figures of participating in child sex trafficking before dying mysteriously in 2019 after allegedly throwing himself off an overpass. Many of the [claims he made have since resurfaced in court documents and intelligence leaks,](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/22/22-6123/249289/20221207110348061_20221207-105913-00002422-00000045.pdf) raising serious suspicions that his death was a coordinated silencing rather than a suicide.  
* **The Nikolai Mushegian Warning:** On October 28, 2022, 29-year-old crypto billionaire and MakerDAO co-founder Nikolai Mushegian posted a chilling public warning to his Twitter account: *"CIA and Mossad and pedo elite are running some kind of sex trafficking entrapment blackmail ring out of Puerto Rico and caribbean islands."* He claimed intelligence agencies were preparing to frame and kill him. Just hours after hitting 'send' on that exact tweet, Mushegian was found dead…fully clothed with his wallet in his pocket in the water off a Puerto Rican beach. Death ruled ‘accidental drowning.’  
* **Model claiming elite rituals/cannibalism**:The vanishing of a model named [gabriela rico jimenez who spoke up about elite parties where they eat people and perform satanic rituals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhVrTo2JRVM). She was admitted into  a psychiatric hospital and then never seen again.   
* **Kids claiming elite rituals/cannibalism:** A 2014 video features two children from Hampstead, London, [alleging that community members were part of a satanic cult committing ritual abuse and cannibalism](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhyDoWeNeverAsk/comments/1qzhi7v/this_video_has_nothing_to_do_with_epstein_but_the/).   
* However, an extensive investigation by the UK Metropolitan Police and the High Court found absolutely no evidence to support these extreme claims. Authorities ultimately determined that the children had been heavily coached and coerced into making the false statements by their mother and her partner.
