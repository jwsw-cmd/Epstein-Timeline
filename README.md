# Epstein Timeline Archive

**A detailed narrative of Jeffrey Epstein's operations, trafficking allegations, blackmail (kompromat) claims, systemic cover-ups, DOJ file releases (EFTA PDFs), Interlochen connections, and related developments.

**Last updated:** February 18, 2026  
**Source:** Public DOJ justice.gov/epstein files, survivor accounts (Maria Farmer, Virginia Giuffre), news (Miami Herald, PBS, WSJ, BuzzFeed), and user notes.  
**Purpose:** Organize events chronologically for readability; highlight key documents and allegations. Speculative elements noted as such.

## Executive Summary (from Doc)
The evidence suggests Epstein & Maxwell trafficked minors to elites for blackmail purposes. Government redactions, missing files, and protection of co-conspirators indicate an ongoing state-level cover-up. Not a "lone wolf" operation.
